REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 bitmap/screen_reg_0_0 has an input control pin bitmap/screen_reg_0_0/ADDRARDADDR[14] (net: bitmap/ADDR[14]) which is driven by a register (idisplay_manager/igest_diplay/FSM_sequential_scurrent_reg[4]) that has an active asychronous set or reset.

REQP-1840#8 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 idisplay_manager/idisplay_life/irom_life/DATA_OUT_reg has an input control pin idisplay_manager/idisplay_life/irom_life/DATA_OUT_reg/ADDRARDADDR[5] (net: idisplay_manager/idisplay_life/irom_life/ADDRARDADDR[3]) which is driven by a register (idisplay_manager/idisplay_life/cmt_addr_rom_reg[3]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
